          Almost all visitors arrive to Taniti by air, though some arrive on a
          small cruise ship that docks in Yellow Leaf Bay for one night per
          week. Taniti is served by a small airport that can accommodate small
          jets and propeller planes. Taniti is in the process of expanding the
          airport so larger jets will be able to land on the island within the
          next few years.

            Public buses serve Taniti City and run from 5 a.m. to 11 p.m. every
            day. Private buses serve the rest of the island. Taxis are available
            in Taniti City, and rental cars can be rented from a local rental
            agency near the airport. Bikes and helmets are available to rent
            from several vendors (helmets are required by law). Taniti City is
            fairly flat and very walkable. Many tourists stay in the area
            surrounding Merriton Landing: this area is easy to explore on foot.
